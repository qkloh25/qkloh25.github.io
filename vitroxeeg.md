**Project description:** This is a project assigned to me for a 3-months internship. This is my very first research project. The task is to study EEG data and try to use AI to detect epilepsy. Later, the customer change the objective and requested me to train a AI to detect spike in the sequence data instead of the epilepsy itself.

### 1. Replicating the papers
I acquired the skill of consuming a paper and replicating them. I know how to differentiate a detail paper and a paper with missing parts. I am now capable to find key points and highlights of a paper and eventually code them out to replicate their result if all the details are well written.

### 2. Paper review
I learned how to evaluate a paper. Is the paper valid? Is the paper reliable? What is the background of the writers? Is the author expert or new in the filed? I also try to think what can be improve if I were the author.

### 3. Develop data processing techniques and AI.
EEG data processing have a very small community supporting. I faced a couple of technical problems, one of the problems is slow data fetch when training a AI model. This caused the training process did not utilize the GPU. I fix this problem with a original script, this is one of the biggest production of this project that make me proud.

### 4. Weekly Presentation
Every week, I have to present my experiment and results in a meeting. This experience make me always prepare to present my work precisely and clearly to my supervisor. It keep me stay focus on the goal and results that I can produce so I wouldn't lost in the process and fall behind.

### 5. Summary
I managed to train the model and the train accuracy, f1 are all very close to 100%. However, the model performance will drop drasrically if it is used on new patient. This is very common issue known as domain shift in medical AI. The company and doctor are satisfied with my work and presentation and agree to let me continue work on it if I have any new ideas.
