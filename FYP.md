## Variable Autonomy Robotic Guidance Based on Human Stress Levels Indicated by Physiological Signals

**Project description:** This is an on-going final-year project about human-robot interaction.The aim of the project is to find a good agreement in shared-control between human and robot decision maker by investigating the possibility of using physiological signals to improve the overall performance of shared-control.

### 1. Predict cognitive load level using Electrodermal Activity (EDA)

EDA is the electricity activity on human skin. There are studies showed that skin conductance level have noticeable change when the subject were facing difficult task. This project aim to extract this correlation and used this information to predict cognitive load level to have better robotics assistance to the subject.

### 2. Shared-Control Mechanism

How much control should be given to the robot? What is the evaluation of a shared-control mechanism? Is shared-control superior than full human control or full robot control? These are the questions I am tackling with.

### 3. Haptics Device
There are many aspect to implement the shared-control. In this project, we study in the aspect of haptics device where the subject can feel the assistance from robot by touch, and the robot can know information from human's applied force and their skin conductance level.

### 4. Game Development
I need to develop a game to act as the task. The game needed to has different level of difficulty. The player should feel the dynamics of the game play and the assitance of robot by touch. The game is developed using library CHAI3D, a powerful cross-platform C++ simulation framework. CHAI3D is an open source framework that supports a variety of commercially-available three-, six- and seven-degree-of-freedom haptic devices, and makes it simple to support new custom force feedback devices.

### 5. Reinforcement Learning 
This is an optional section for the project, to investigate the performance of AI in the same task.
