## Shopee Code League 2020

**Project description:** This is a data science competition organised by a e-commence company named Shopee. I joined the competition with very little knowledge about AI. There are many parts in the competition, as a beginner, I only focus on one part of the competition which is to develop a model to recognise the product in a picture. The duration is 2 weeks. I tried my best and manage to achieve an accuracy of 49%.

### 1. My very first experience training a CNN model
This is my first AI project where I need to take care every details of the pipeline. I designed every component of the pipeline, from data preparing, hyper-parameter tuning to evaluation. I done all this using pytorch while learning how to use it.

### 2. My very first experience to deal with big data
The shopee dataset is huge, the dataset contains many product from its platform and occupy nearly 10GB. I learned how to arrange and manage them, and do data augmentation to train for more robust model.

### 3. Learn to learn quick
As someone who had only a little knowledge about CNN. I managed to use pytorch and some template online to train a resnet and achieve an accuracy of 49% in only 2 weeks.
