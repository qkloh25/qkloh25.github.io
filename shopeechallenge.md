## Shopee Code League 2020

**Project description:** This is a data science competition organised by a e-commence company named Shopee. I joined the competition with very little knowledge about AI. There are many parts in the competition, as a beginner, I only focus on one part of the competition which is to develop a model to recognise the product in a picture. The duration is 2 weeks. I tried my best and manage to achieve an accuracy of 49%.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena


### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based


### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques



### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
